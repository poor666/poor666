# ðŸ‘‹Â Hello. 

# I make things on the Internet.

> My name is JoÃ£o Ramos, a hybrid software developer from Porto, Portugal with over 20 years of experience in the industry. I have a strong background in back-end, front-end, design and UX, which allows me to build anything from scratch. Maybe Iâ€™m the right person if you need someone with these skills.

Although I did not complete a degree, I consider myself self-taught and constantly seek to learn and improve my skills. I have experience with various programming languages, frameworks, and development methodologies.

In addition to software development, I lead an active lifestyle, balancing my professional work with a healthy routine. This helps me stay focused and efficient in my work and personal life.
